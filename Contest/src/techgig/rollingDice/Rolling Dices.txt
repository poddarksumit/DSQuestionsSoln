Two persons are playing a game of rolling 2 dices. Each person roll the two dices n times and record the outcomes( some of value of two dices) of
all the n attempts. So after n attempts of both the player we have two list corresponding to the n outcomes of two players. They want to know that
whether they have got all possible outcomes( 2 to 12) same number of times or not. If they got all the possible outcomes same number of times then
they are called lucky otherwise unlucky. So the question is that you have two list corresponding to the outcomes of two players you have to decide 
that whether the two players are lucky or not.

Input Specification:

Two list (L1, L2) corresponding to outcomes of two players.

Output:

Lucky/Unlucky

Example: Two players the rolling 2 dices 7 times

Player one outcomes: { 12, 11, 5, 2, 7, 5, 11}

Player two outcomes: { 5, 12, 5, 7, 11, 2, 11}

Both the players are lucky because they have got
11(2 times each),
5(2 times each),
7( 1 time each),
2( 1 time each),
12( 1 time each)
and all other outputs (0 times each).

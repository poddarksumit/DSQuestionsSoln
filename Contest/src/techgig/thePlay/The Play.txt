N boys and M girls are learning acting skills from a theatre in Mumbai. To perform a play on ‘Ramayana’ they need to form a group of P actors
containing not less than 4 boys and not less than 1 girl. The theatre requires you to write a program that tells them the number of ways the group
can be formed

Input Specs

 

Your program must read two arguments (t, string1) where 

t is the number of test cases (1 = t = 100)

string1 is a string that provides you the details of each test case. The test cases are separated by a comma (,) as shown below

test_case1, test_case2, test_case3....

The data in each test case starts and end with brackets ( ). Within the brackets lies the following information separated by a comma (,)

n, m, p where (4 = n = 100, 1 = m = 20, 5 = p = n+m),

n, m represents the number of boys and girls
p represent the number of actors required for the play.

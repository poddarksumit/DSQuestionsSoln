Ms. Anna is very naughty in her classes and due to this her teacher has given her a punishment. Her teacher asked her to create a program for a 
positive integer i , which can find all possible sequences of positive integers x1, x2, ..., xp such that the sum of all p elements of the above 
sequence is equal to i and for each r, 1 <= r < p we have xr+1- xr in {-2, 0, 3}. Please help her in creating this program.

Input Specs 

In the first line you're given i ( 0 < i â‰¤ 10 ). 

Output Specs 

You need to output result to variable output1 as string. Sequences must be given in the lexicographic order, with each sequence enclosed in { }. 
The numbers within each sequence enclosed in { } must be separated by comma. 

Note: In case there is no possible solution, you need to return -999 as output.
